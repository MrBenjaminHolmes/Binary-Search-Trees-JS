# Binary-Search-Trees-JS
An implementation of a binary search tree data structure written in JavaScript.

Includes the following methods:

`insert(value)` - inserts a new node with the given value into the tree<br />
`remove(value)` - removes the node holding the given value from the tree<br />
`find(value)` - returns the node holding the given value in the tree<br />
`levelOrder()` - traverses each node of the tree in level order<br />
`inOrder()` - traverses each node of the tree inorder<br />
`preOrder()` - traverses each node of the tree preorder<br />
`postOrder()` - traverses each node of the tree postorder<br />
`height()` - returns the height of a node -- defined as the longest path between the node and a leaf node<br />
`depth()` - returns the depth of a node -- defined as the distance between the node and the root<br />
`isBalanced()` - returns true/false based on whether or not the tree is balanced<br />
`rebalance()` - rebalances the tree<br />
`prettyPrint` - prints the tree in the console in a human reader friendly format<br />
Also included is a small script that tests most of the tree's functionality.
